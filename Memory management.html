<h2 style="text-align:justify;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed">
<span class="mw-headline"><span style="color:windowtext">Memory management<o:p></o:p></span></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify">Among other things, a multiprogramming operating 
system
<span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-fareast-theme-font:
major-fareast">kernel</span> must be responsible for managing all system memory 
which is currently in use by programs. This ensures that a program does not 
interfere with memory already in use by another program. Since programs time 
share, each program must have independent access to memory. <o:p></o:p></p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Cooperative memory management, used by many early 
operating systems, assumes that all programs make voluntary use of the
<span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-fareast-theme-font:major-fareast">
kernel</span>'s memory manager, and do not exceed their allocated memory. This 
system of memory management is almost never seen any more, since programs often 
contain bugs which can cause them to exceed their allocated memory. If a program 
fails, it may cause memory used by one or more other programs to be affected or 
overwritten. Malicious programs or viruses may purposefully alter another 
program's memory, or may affect the operation of the operating system itself. 
With cooperative memory management, it takes only one misbehaved program to 
crash the system. <o:p></o:p></p>
<p style="text-align:justify">
<span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
mso-fareast-theme-font:major-fareast">Memory protection</span> enables the
<span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-fareast-theme-font:major-fareast">
kernel</span> to limit a process' access to the computer's memory. Various 
methods of memory protection exist, including
<span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
mso-fareast-theme-font:major-fareast">memory segmentation</span> and
<span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-fareast-theme-font:major-fareast">
paging</span>. All methods require some level of hardware support (such as the
<span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-fareast-theme-font:major-fareast">
80286</span> MMU), which doesn't exist in all computers. <o:p></o:p></p>
<p style="text-align:justify">In both segmentation and paging, certain
<span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-fareast-theme-font:major-fareast">
protected mode</span> registers specify to the CPU what memory address it should 
allow a running program to access. Attempts to access other addresses trigger an 
interrupt which cause the CPU to re-enter
<span style="mso-fareast-font-family:
&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-fareast-theme-font:major-fareast">supervisor 
mode</span>, placing the
<span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-fareast-theme-font:
major-fareast">kernel</span> in charge. This is called a
<span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-fareast-theme-font:major-fareast">
segmentation violation</span> or Seg-V for short, and since it is both difficult 
to assign a meaningful result to such an operation, and because it is usually a 
sign of a misbehaving program, the
<span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
mso-fareast-theme-font:major-fareast">kernel</span> generally resorts to 
terminating the offending program, and reports the error. <o:p></o:p></p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Windows versions 3.1 through ME had some level of 
memory protection, but programs could easily circumvent the need to use it. A
<span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-fareast-theme-font:major-fareast">
general protection fault</span> would be produced, indicating a segmentation 
violation had occurred; however, the system would often crash anyway. <o:p></o:p>
</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed">
<span class="mw-headline"><span style="color:windowtext">Virtual memory<o:p></o:p></span></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify">The use of virtual memory addressing (such as 
paging or segmentation) means that the kernel can choose what memory each 
program may use at any given time, allowing the operating system to use the same 
memory locations for multiple tasks. <o:p></o:p></p>
<p style="text-align:justify">If a program tries to access memory that isn't in 
its current range of accessible memory, but nonetheless has been allocated to 
it, the kernel is interrupted in the same way as it would if the program were to 
exceed its allocated memory. (See section on memory management.) Under UNIX this 
kind of interrupt is referred to as a
<span style="mso-fareast-font-family:
&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-fareast-theme-font:major-fareast">page fault</span>. <o:p></o:p>
</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">When the kernel detects a page fault it generally 
adjusts the virtual memory range of the program which triggered it, granting it 
access to the memory requested. This gives the kernel discretionary power over 
where a particular application's memory is stored, or even whether or not it has 
actually been allocated yet. <o:p></o:p></p>
<p style="text-align:justify">In modern operating systems, memory which is 
accessed less frequently can be temporarily stored on disk or other media to 
make that space available for use by other programs. This is called
<span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-fareast-theme-font:major-fareast">
swapping</span>, as an area of memory can be used by multiple programs, and what 
that memory area contains can be swapped or exchanged on demand. <o:p></o:p></p>
<p style="text-align:justify">"Virtual memory" provides the programmer or the 
user with the perception that there is a much larger amount of RAM in the 
computer than is really there. <o:p></o:p></p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed">
<span class="mw-headline"><span style="color:windowtext">Multitasking<o:p></o:p></span></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify">
<span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
mso-fareast-theme-font:major-fareast">Multitasking</span> refers to the running 
of multiple independent computer programs on the same computer; giving the 
appearance that it is performing the tasks at the same time. Since most 
computers can do at most one or two things at one time, this is generally done 
via time-sharing, which means that each program uses a share of the computer's 
time to execute. <o:p></o:p></p>
<p style="text-align:justify">An operating system
<span style="mso-fareast-font-family:
&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-fareast-theme-font:major-fareast">kernel</span> 
contains a
<span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-fareast-theme-font:
major-fareast">scheduling</span> program which determines how much time each 
process spends executing, and in which order execution control should be passed 
to programs. Control is passed to a process by the kernel, which allows the 
program access to the
<span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
mso-fareast-theme-font:major-fareast">CPU</span> and memory. Later, control is 
returned to the kernel through some mechanism, so that another program may be 
allowed to use the CPU. This so-called passing of control between the kernel and 
applications is called a
<span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
mso-fareast-theme-font:major-fareast">context switch</span>. <o:p></o:p></p>
<p style="text-align:justify">An early model which governed the allocation of 
time to programs was called
<span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
mso-fareast-theme-font:major-fareast">cooperative multitasking</span>. In this 
model, when control is passed to a program by the kernel, it may execute for as 
long as it wants before explicitly returning control to the kernel. This means 
that a malicious or malfunctioning program may not only prevent any other 
programs from using the CPU, but it can hang the entire system if it enters an
<span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-fareast-theme-font:major-fareast">
infinite loop</span>. <o:p></o:p></p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Modern operating systems extend the concepts of 
application preemption to device drivers and kernel code, so that the operating 
system has preemptive control over internal run-times as well. <o:p></o:p></p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The philosophy governing
<span style="mso-fareast-font-family:
&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-fareast-theme-font:major-fareast">preemptive 
multitasking</span> is that of ensuring that all programs are given regular time 
on the CPU. This implies that all programs must be limited in how much time they 
are allowed to spend on the CPU without being interrupted. To accomplish this, 
modern operating system kernels make use of a timed interrupt. A
<span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-fareast-theme-font:major-fareast">
protected mode</span> timer is set by the kernel which triggers a return to 
supervisor mode after the specified time has elapsed. (See above sections on 
Interrupts and Dual Mode Operation.) <o:p></o:p></p>
<p style="text-align:justify">On many single user operating systems cooperative 
multitasking is perfectly adequate, as home computers generally run a small 
number of well tested programs. The
<span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
mso-fareast-theme-font:major-fareast">AmigaOS</span> is an exception, having 
preemptive multitasking from its first version.
<span style="mso-fareast-font-family:
&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-fareast-theme-font:major-fareast">Windows NT</span> 
was the first version of
<span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
mso-fareast-theme-font:major-fareast">Microsoft Windows</span> which enforced 
preemptive multitasking, but it didn't reach the home user market until
<span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-fareast-theme-font:major-fareast">
Windows XP</span> (since
<span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
mso-fareast-theme-font:major-fareast">Windows NT</span> was targeted at 
professionals). <o:p></o:p></p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed">
<span class="mw-headline"><span style="color:windowtext">Disk access and file 
systems<o:p></o:p></span></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify">Access to data stored on disks is a central 
feature of all operating systems. Computers store data on
<span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-fareast-theme-font:major-fareast">
disks</span> using
<span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-fareast-theme-font:
major-fareast">files</span>, which are structured in specific ways in order to 
allow for faster access, higher reliability, and to make better use of the 
drive's available space. The specific way in which files are stored on a disk is 
called a
<span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-fareast-theme-font:
major-fareast">file system</span>, and enables files to have names and 
attributes. It also allows them to be stored in a hierarchy of directories or 
folders arranged in a
<span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
mso-fareast-theme-font:major-fareast">directory tree</span>. <o:p></o:p></p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Early operating systems generally supported a 
single type of disk drive and only one kind of file system. Early file systems 
were limited in their capacity, speed, and in the kinds of file names and 
directory structures they could use. These limitations often reflected 
limitations in the operating systems they were designed for, making it very 
difficult for an operating system to support more than one file system. <o:p></o:p>
</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">While many simpler operating systems support a 
limited range of options for accessing storage systems, operating systems like
<span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-fareast-theme-font:major-fareast">
UNIX</span> and
<span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-fareast-theme-font:
major-fareast">Linux</span> support a technology known as a
<span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-fareast-theme-font:major-fareast">
virtual file system</span> or VFS. An operating system such as UNIX supports a 
wide array of storage devices, regardless of their design or
<span style="mso-fareast-font-family:
&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-fareast-theme-font:major-fareast">file systems</span>, 
allowing them to be accessed through a common
<span style="mso-fareast-font-family:
&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-fareast-theme-font:major-fareast">application 
programming interface</span> (API). This makes it unnecessary for programs to 
have any knowledge about the device they are accessing. A VFS allows the 
operating system to provide programs with access to an unlimited number of 
devices with an infinite variety of file systems installed on them, through the 
use of specific
<span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-fareast-theme-font:
major-fareast">device drivers</span> and file system drivers. <o:p></o:p></p>
<p style="text-align:justify">A connected
<span style="mso-fareast-font-family:
&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-fareast-theme-font:major-fareast">storage device</span>, 
such as a
<span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-fareast-theme-font:
major-fareast">hard drive</span>, is accessed through a
<span style="mso-fareast-font-family:
&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-fareast-theme-font:major-fareast">device driver</span>. 
The device driver understands the specific language of the drive and is able to 
translate that language into a standard language used by the operating system to 
access all disk drives. On UNIX, this is the language of
<span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-fareast-theme-font:major-fareast">
block devices</span>. <o:p></o:p></p>
<p style="text-align:justify">When the kernel has an appropriate device driver 
in place, it can then access the contents of the disk drive in raw format, which 
may contain one or more file systems. A file system driver is used to translate 
the commands used to access each specific file system into a standard set of 
commands that the operating system can use to talk to all file systems. Programs 
can then deal with these file systems on the basis of filenames, and 
directories/folders, contained within a hierarchical structure. They can create, 
delete, open, and close files, as well as gather various information about them, 
including access permissions, size, free space, and creation and modification 
dates. <o:p></o:p></p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Various differences between file systems make 
supporting all file systems difficult. Allowed characters in file names,
<span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-fareast-theme-font:major-fareast">
case sensitivity</span>, and the presence of various kinds of
<span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-fareast-theme-font:major-fareast">
file attributes</span> makes the implementation of a single interface for every 
file system a daunting task. Operating systems tend to recommend using (and so 
support natively) file systems specifically designed for them; for example,
<span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-fareast-theme-font:major-fareast">
NTFS</span> in Windows and
<span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
mso-fareast-theme-font:major-fareast">ext3</span> and
<span style="mso-fareast-font-family:
&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-fareast-theme-font:major-fareast">ReiserFS</span> 
in Linux. However, in practice, third party drivers are usually available to 
give support for the most widely used file systems in most general-purpose 
operating systems (for example, NTFS is available in Linux through
<span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-fareast-theme-font:major-fareast">
NTFS-3g</span>, and ext2/3 and ReiserFS are available in Windows through 
third-party software).
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Support for file systems is highly varied among 
modern operating systems, although there are several common file systems which 
almost all operating systems include support and drivers for. Operating systems 
vary on file system support and on the disk formats they may be installed on. 
Under Windows, each file system is usually limited in application to certain 
media; for example, CDs must use
<span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
mso-fareast-theme-font:major-fareast">ISO 9660</span> or
<span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-fareast-theme-font:major-fareast">
UDF</span>, and as of
<span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-fareast-theme-font:
major-fareast">Windows Vista</span>, NTFS is the only file system which the 
operating system can be installed on. It is possible to install Linux onto many 
types of file systems. Unlike other operating systems, Linux and UNIX allow any 
file system to be used regardless of the media it is stored in, whether it is a 
hard drive, a disc (CD, DVD...), a USB flash drive, or even contained within a 
file located on another file system. <o:p></o:p></p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed">
<span class="mw-headline"><span style="color:windowtext">Device drivers<o:p></o:p></span></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify">A
<span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
mso-fareast-theme-font:major-fareast">device driver</span> is a specific type of 
computer software developed to allow interaction with hardware devices. 
Typically this constitutes an interface for communicating with the device, 
through the specific computer bus or communications subsystem that the hardware 
is connected to, providing commands to and/or receiving data from the device, 
and on the other end, the requisite interfaces to the operating system and 
software applications. It is a specialized hardware-dependent computer program 
which is also operating system specific that enables another program, typically 
an operating system or applications software package or computer program running 
under the operating system kernel, to interact transparently with a hardware 
device, and usually provides the requisite interrupt handling necessary for any 
necessary asynchronous time-dependent hardware interfacing needs. <o:p></o:p>
</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The key design goal of device drivers is
<span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-fareast-theme-font:major-fareast">
abstraction</span>. Every model of hardware (even within the same class of 
device) is different. Newer models also are released by manufacturers that 
provide more reliable or better performance and these newer models are often 
controlled differently. Computers and their operating systems cannot be expected 
to know how to control every device, both now and in the future. To solve this 
problem, operating systems essentially dictate how every type of device should 
be controlled. The function of the device driver is then to translate these 
operating system mandated function calls into device specific calls. In theory a 
new device, which is controlled in a new manner, should function correctly if a 
suitable driver is available. This new driver ensures that the device appears to 
operate as usual from the operating system's point of view. <o:p></o:p></p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Under versions of Windows before Vista and 
versions of Linux before 2.6, all driver execution was co-operative, meaning 
that if a driver entered an infinite loop it would freeze the system. More 
recent revisions of these operating systems incorporate kernel preemption, where 
the kernel interrupts the driver to give it tasks, and then separates itself 
from the process until it receives a response from the device driver, or gives 
it more tasks to do. <o:p></o:p></p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed">
<span class="mw-headline"><span style="color:windowtext">Networking</span></span><span style="color:windowtext"><o:p></o:p></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify">Currently most operating systems support a variety 
of networking protocols, hardware, and applications for using them. This means 
that computers running dissimilar operating systems can participate in a common
<span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-fareast-theme-font:
major-fareast">network</span> for sharing resources such as
<span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-fareast-theme-font:major-fareast">
computing</span>, files, printers, and scanners using either wired or wireless 
connections. Networks can essentially allow a computer's operating system to 
access the resources of a remote computer to support the same functions as it 
could if those resources were connected directly to the local computer. This 
includes everything from simple communication, to using networked file systems 
or even sharing another computer's graphics or sound hardware. Some network 
services allow the resources of a computer to be accessed transparently, such as
<span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-fareast-theme-font:major-fareast">
SSH</span> which allows networked users direct access to a computer's command 
line interface. <o:p></o:p></p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Client/server networking allows a program on a 
computer, called a client, to connect via a network to another computer, called 
a server. Servers offer (or host) various services to other network computers 
and users. These services are usually provided through ports or numbered access 
points beyond the server's
<span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
mso-fareast-theme-font:major-fareast">IP address</span>. Each port number is 
usually associated with a maximum of one running program, which is responsible 
for handling requests to that port. A daemon, being a user program, can in turn 
access the local hardware resources of that computer by passing requests to the 
operating system kernel. <o:p></o:p></p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Many operating systems support one or more 
vendor-specific or open networking protocols as well, for example,
<span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-fareast-theme-font:major-fareast">
SNA</span> on
<span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-fareast-theme-font:
major-fareast">IBM</span> systems,
<span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
mso-fareast-theme-font:major-fareast">DEC net</span> on systems from
<span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-fareast-theme-font:major-fareast">
Digital Equipment Corporation</span>, and Microsoft-specific protocols (<span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-fareast-theme-font:major-fareast">SMB</span>) 
on Windows. Specific protocols for specific tasks may also be supported such as
<span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-fareast-theme-font:
major-fareast">NFS</span> for file access. Protocols like
<span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-fareast-theme-font:major-fareast">
ESound</span>, or esd can be easily extended over the network to provide sound 
from local applications, on a remote system's sound hardware. <o:p></o:p></p>
