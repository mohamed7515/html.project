<p style="text-align:justify">A computer being secure depends on a number of 
technologies working properly. A modern operating system provides access to a 
number of resources, which are available to software running on the system, and 
to external devices like networks via the kernel. <o:p></o:p></p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The operating system must be capable of 
distinguishing between requests which should be allowed to be processed, and 
others which should not be processed. While some systems may simply distinguish 
between "privileged" and "non-privileged", systems commonly have a form of 
requester <i>identity</i>, such as a user name. To establish identity there may 
be a process of <i>authentication</i>. Often a username must be quoted, and each 
username may have a password. Other methods of authentication, such as magnetic 
cards or biometric data, might be used instead. In some cases, especially 
connections from the network, resources may be accessed with no authentication 
at all (such as reading files over a network share). Also covered by the concept 
of requester <b>identity</b> is <i>authorization</i>; the particular services 
and resources accessible by the requester once logged into a system are tied to 
either the requester's user account or to the variously configured groups of 
users to which the requester belongs. <o:p></o:p></p>
<p style="text-align:justify">In addition to the allow or disallow model of 
security, a system with a high level of security also offers auditing options. 
These would allow tracking of requests for access to resources (such as, "who 
has been reading this file?"). Internal security, or security from an already 
running program is only possible if all possibly harmful requests must be 
carried out through interrupts to the operating system kernel. If programs can 
directly access hardware and resources, they cannot be secured.
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p style="text-align:justify">External security involves a request from outside 
the computer, such as a login at a connected console or some kind of network 
connection. External requests are often passed through device drivers to the 
operating system's kernel, where they can be passed onto applications, or 
carried out directly. Security of operating systems has long been a concern 
because of highly sensitive data held on computers, both of a commercial and 
military nature. The United States

<span style="mso-fareast-font-family:
&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-fareast-theme-font:major-fareast">Department of 
Defense</span> (DoD) created the <i>
<span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
mso-fareast-theme-font:major-fareast">Trusted Computer System Evaluation 
Criteria</span></i> (TCSEC) which is a standard that sets basic requirements for 
assessing the effectiveness of security. This became of vital importance to 
operating system makers, because the TCSEC was used to evaluate, classify and 
select
<span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-fareast-theme-font:
major-fareast">trusted operating systems</span> being considered for the 
processing, storage and retrieval of sensitive or
<span style="mso-fareast-font-family:
&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-fareast-theme-font:major-fareast">classified 
information</span>.
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Network services include offerings such as file 
sharing, print services, email, web sites, and
<span style="mso-fareast-font-family:
&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-fareast-theme-font:major-fareast">file transfer 
protocols</span> (FTP), most of which can have compromised security. At the 
front line of security are hardware devices known as
<span style="mso-fareast-font-family:
&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-fareast-theme-font:major-fareast">firewalls</span> 
or intrusion detection/prevention systems. At the operating system level, there 
are a number of software firewalls available, as well as intrusion 
detection/prevention systems. Most modern operating systems include a software 
firewall, which is enabled by default. A software firewall can be configured to 
allow or deny network traffic to or from a service or application running on the 
operating system. Therefore, one can install and be running an insecure service, 
such as Telnet or FTP, and not have to be threatened by a security breach 
because the firewall would deny all traffic trying to connect to the service on 
that port. <o:p></o:p></p>
<p style="text-align:justify">An alternative strategy, and the only
<span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-fareast-theme-font:major-fareast">
sandbox</span> strategy available in systems that do not meet the
<span style="mso-fareast-font-family:
&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-fareast-theme-font:major-fareast">Popek and 
Goldberg virtualization requirements</span>, is where the operating system is 
not running user programs as native code, but instead either
<span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-fareast-theme-font:major-fareast">
emulates</span> a processor or provides a host for a
<span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
mso-fareast-theme-font:major-fareast">p-code</span> based system such as Java. <o:p></o:p>
</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Internal security is especially relevant for 
multi-user systems; it allows each user of the system to have private files that 
the other users cannot tamper with or read. Internal security is also vital if 
auditing is to be of any use, since a program can potentially bypass the 
operating system, inclusive of bypassing auditing. <o:p></o:p></p>
