<span class="mw-headline"><span style="color:windowtext">User interface<o:p></o:p></span></span></h2>
<p dir="LTR" style="text-align:justify">Every computer that is to be operated by 
an individual requires a
<span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
mso-fareast-theme-font:major-fareast">user interface</span>. The user interface 
is usually referred to as a
<span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
mso-fareast-theme-font:major-fareast">shell</span> and is essential if human 
interaction is to be supported. The user interface views the
<span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-fareast-theme-font:major-fareast">
directory structure</span> and requests services from the operating system that 
will acquire data from
<span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
mso-fareast-theme-font:major-fareast">input hardware devices</span>, such as a
<span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-fareast-theme-font:major-fareast">
keyboard</span>,
<span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-fareast-theme-font:
major-fareast">mouse</span> or
<span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
mso-fareast-theme-font:major-fareast">credit card reader</span>, and requests 
operating system services to display
<span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
mso-fareast-theme-font:major-fareast">prompts</span>,
<span style="mso-fareast-font-family:
&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-fareast-theme-font:major-fareast">status 
messages</span> and such on
<span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-fareast-theme-font:
major-fareast">output hardware devices</span>, such as a
<span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-fareast-theme-font:major-fareast">
video monitor</span> or
<span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
mso-fareast-theme-font:major-fareast">printer</span>. The two most common forms 
of a user interface have historically been the
<span style="mso-fareast-font-family:
&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-fareast-theme-font:major-fareast">command-line 
interface</span>, where computer commands are typed out line-by-line, and the
<span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-fareast-theme-font:major-fareast">
graphical user interface</span>, where a visual environment (most commonly a
<span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-fareast-theme-font:major-fareast">
WIMP</span>) is present. <o:p></o:p></p>
<h2 dir="LTR" style="text-align:justify;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed">
<span class="mw-headline"><span style="color:windowtext">Graphical user 
interfaces<o:p></o:p></span></span></h2>
<p dir="LTR" style="text-align:justify">Most of the modern computer systems 
support
<span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-fareast-theme-font:
major-fareast">graphical user interfaces</span> (GUI), and often include them. 
In some computer systems, such as the original implementation of the
<span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-fareast-theme-font:major-fareast">
classic Mac OS</span>, the GUI is integrated into the
<span style="mso-fareast-font-family:
&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-fareast-theme-font:major-fareast">kernel</span>. <o:p></o:p>
</p>
<p dir="LTR" style="text-align:justify">While technically a graphical user 
interface is not an operating system service, incorporating support for one into 
the operating system kernel can allow the GUI to be more responsive by reducing 
the number of
<span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
mso-fareast-theme-font:major-fareast">context switches</span> required for the 
GUI to perform its output functions. Other operating systems are
<span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-fareast-theme-font:major-fareast">
modular</span>, separating the graphics subsystem from the kernel and the 
Operating System. In the 1980s UNIX, VMS and many others had operating systems 
that were built this way. Linux and macOS are also built this way. Modern 
releases of Microsoft Windows such as
<span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
mso-fareast-theme-font:major-fareast">Windows Vista</span> implement a graphics 
subsystem that is mostly in user-space; however the graphics drawing routines of 
versions between
<span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
mso-fareast-theme-font:major-fareast">Windows NT 4.0</span> and
<span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-fareast-theme-font:major-fareast">
Windows Server 2003</span> exist mostly in kernel space.
<span style="mso-fareast-font-family:
&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-fareast-theme-font:major-fareast">Windows 9x</span> 
had very little distinction between the interface and the kernel. <o:p></o:p>
</p>
<p dir="LTR" style="text-align:justify">Many computer operating systems allow 
the user to install or create any user interface they desire. The
<span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-fareast-theme-font:major-fareast">
X&nbsp;Window System</span> in conjunction with
<span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
mso-fareast-theme-font:major-fareast">GNOME</span> or
<span style="mso-fareast-font-family:
&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-fareast-theme-font:major-fareast">KDE Plasma 5</span> 
is a commonly found setup on most Unix and
<span style="mso-fareast-font-family:
&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-fareast-theme-font:major-fareast">Unix-like</span> 
(BSD, Linux, Solaris) systems. A number of
<span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
mso-fareast-theme-font:major-fareast">Windows shell replacements</span> have 
been released for Microsoft Windows, which offer alternatives to the included
<span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-fareast-theme-font:major-fareast">
Windows shell</span>, but the shell itself cannot be separated from Windows. <o:p></o:p>
</p>
<p dir="LTR" style="text-align:justify">Numerous Unix-based GUIs have existed 
over time, most derived from X11. Competition among the various vendors of Unix 
(HP, IBM, Sun) led to much fragmentation, though an effort to standardize in the 
1990s to
<span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-fareast-theme-font:
major-fareast">COSE</span> and
<span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
mso-fareast-theme-font:major-fareast">CDE</span> failed for various reasons, and 
were eventually eclipsed by the widespread adoption of GNOME and
<span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-fareast-theme-font:major-fareast">
K Desktop Environment</span>. Prior to
<span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
mso-fareast-theme-font:major-fareast">free software</span>-based toolkits and 
desktop environments, Motif was the prevalent toolkit/desktop combination (and 
was the basis upon which CDE was developed). <o:p></o:p></p>
<p dir="LTR" style="text-align:justify">Graphical user interfaces evolve over 
time. For example, Windows has modified its user interface almost every time a 
new major version of Windows is released, and the Mac&nbsp;OS GUI changed 
dramatically with the introduction of Mac&nbsp;OS&nbsp;X in 1999. <o:p></o:p></p>
